            <p >I am Shaqayeq Taheri, born in 18th of August 1991 in Hamedan, Iran. In my childhood I was interested in different kind of hobbies. Painting, playing Violine and etc. But from that time I become interested in Design things. I used to make Powerpoint Slides for my school project and work with the colors and the shapes. When it was time to choose my major at university, I decided to choose Arichecture but I don't know why, I choosed Computer science:) <br>
            At first, I thought that this major is not my type and I wouldn't have any success in this major. But after while, I found out that, you can be both an engineer and an artist too! Now it is the time that I am learning Web Development and getting familiar with this techy arty world!  </p>
